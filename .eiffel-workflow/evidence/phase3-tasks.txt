## Dependencies Analysis

### Critical Path (Longest Sequence)
1. Task 1: LR initialization
2. Task 2: LR configuration
3. Task 3: LR training (3 hours)
4. Task 4: LR prediction

**Foundation classes** (others can work in parallel once config is done):
- Linear Regression: foundation for understanding gradient descent
- Logistic Regression: extends Linear with sigmoid
- Decision Tree: independent algorithm
- Random Forest: depends on Decision Tree working
- SVM: independent algorithm
- Neural Network: most complex, independent

### Blocking Dependencies
- Task 12 (RF training) blocks on Task 10 (DT prediction working correctly)
- No circular dependencies detected

### Parallelizable Tasks
- All initialization tasks (1, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17)
- All configuration tasks (2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17)
- Can work on multiple algorithms simultaneously

## Estimation & Risk

### Effort Breakdown
| Complexity | Tasks | Hours | Risk |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|
| Simple (≤1h) | 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 | 6.5 | Low |
| Medium (1-3h) | 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 | 16 | Medium |
| Complex (3-6h) | 3, 9, 15, 18 | 18 | High |

### Risk Areas
1. **Task 3 (Linear Regression):** Matrix operations via simple_linalg - risk if API differs
2. **Task 9 (Decision Tree):** Information gain calculation complexity
3. **Task 18 (Neural Network):** Backpropagation implementation - most algorithmic complexity
4. **Task 15 (SVM):** Subgradient descent convergence behavior

### Mitigation
- Tasks ordered by dependency, not complexity
- Simpler foundational tasks (LR) first
- Can debug on smaller algorithms before complex ones

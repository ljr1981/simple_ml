- ✓ Ecosystem integration: All simple_* dependencies documented
- ✓ SCOOP compatibility: Full concurrency support enabled
- ✓ Void-safety: void_safety="all" enforced throughout

### Test Coverage
- ✓ 40 Functional Tests: Core functionality verification
- ✓ 40 Adversarial Tests: Boundary values, stress tests, edge cases
- ✓ **100% Pass Rate:** All 80 tests passing (80/80 PASS)

### Compilation Status
- ✓ System Recompiled successfully
- ✓ **Zero compilation warnings**
- ✓ Production binary ready: EIFGENs/simple_ml/F_code/simple_ml.exe
